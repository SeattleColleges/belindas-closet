# Introduction to Belinda's Closet
Belinda’s Closet emerged in the fall of 2022 to address the growing need among students for suitable attire on their graduation day. In direct response to this need, the EDIC team (Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Community) at North Seattle College founded and established this crucial resource. The primary goal is to offer essential support to students within the broader Seattle Colleges system, ensuring they have access to professional clothing for interviews, employment, and graduation ceremonies. Emphasizing its not-for-profit nature, these clothing items come without financial burden to the student.

Currently situated within the Equity & Welcome Center at North Seattle College (NSC), Belinda’s Closet is easily accessible during designated [open hours](https://northseattle.edu/edic/belindas-closet), underscoring its commitment to accessibility. Plans are in motion to extend this invaluable resource to every campus within the Seattle Colleges system.

In a notable development, the Bachelor of Applied Science-Application Development department at NSC embraced Belinda’s Closet as a client in June 2023. The overarching objective has been to develop comprehensive web and Android applications that cater to the digital aspirations of our client and enhance the range of services offered.

These frontend applications, complemented by a shared backend app supporting data and cloud services, are strategically designed. Their primary focus is to empower staff to efficiently manage and update Belinda’s Closet inventory, maintaining the organization's commitment to serving the community. The user interface (UI) aims not only to showcase available items in the store but also to seamlessly connect with the backend, facilitating smooth processing of incoming and outgoing inventory through MongoDB.

## App MVP Progress
As a student team primarily operating asynchronously, our journey commenced in late June '23, working diligently under a grant-approved program at NSC for the initial 100 days. Throughout the summer, we not only made significant strides in our project but also forged strong team bonds, marking our first collaborative experience. Collectively, we reached the milestone of MVP1 by November 3, 2023.
