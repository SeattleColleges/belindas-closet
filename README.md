# Introduction to Belinda's Closet
Belinda’s Closet opened in the Fall of 2022 in response to students needing clothing to wear on graduation day. In response to that request, North Seattle College’s EDIC team (office of equity, diversity, inclusion, and community) established Belinda’s Closet to support students across the Seattle Colleges system who need professional clothing to wear at interviews, work, and of course, graduation.

Presently, the closet is located in the Equity & Welcome Center at North Seattle College (NSC) and is accessible during [open hours](https://northseattle.edu/edic/belindas-closet). Plans are in place to establish a closet on each of the campuses within the Seattle Colleges system: Seattle Central, South Seattle, and Georgetown. 
 
In June of 2023, the Bachelor of Applied Science-Application Development department at NSC took on Belinda's as a client. Our objective has been to build out both web and android-based applications to service the clients' digital aspirations and expand existing services. 

The primary goal of these frontend apps, in addition to a shared backend app supporting data and cloud services, is to give staff the ability to add and edit Belinda's Closet inventory. Further, the UI is meant to showcase items within the stores while connecting with the backend for processing in/outgoing inventory via MongoDB.

## App MVP Progress
